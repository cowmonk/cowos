**Migrated from Rekketstone/cowos**

# cowos
Custom OS from scratch in C

# Notes
**Heavily UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

Currently just boots and well, does nothing lol.

## BUILDING
You'll need a few things:
- LLVM/Clang (default C compiler)
- LLD (linker)
- xorriso (iso creation)
- git
- make
- qemu (for virtual machine)

After acquiring those just run make and it'll do everything for you:
```bash
make
```
